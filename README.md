# TCPModule
> Java TCP Module for developing CS/P2P logic using Netty FrameWork.

Making TCP Application has usully two difficulties.

The first is defining and parsing TCP Message boundary logic, Secondary is handling endian problem.

This project is for understanding these two agenda and providing the sample codes.

## Run

```sh
# 1. make property file like this. location is config/node.properties..
# my ip
ip=192.168.0.4
# my port
port=8890
# other node {ip:port} list.
targetNodeList=192.168.0.140:8891,192.168.0.4:8892
```

```sh
# 2. make Runnable jar file with "CWNode" class in com.cw.node package and run.
java -jar tcpmodule-{version}.jar
```

## Usage example

I will write this section..

## Development setup

you have to install java runtime.

## Release History

* 0.0.1
    * Work in progress.. 
    
I will add two features big/little endian logic and injecting your own Netty handler logic in later version.
